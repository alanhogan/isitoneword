      "notes": "Usually this phrase appears as a verb: “We need to catch up,” “They spent the afternoon catching up.” As a verb, “catch up” is always two words. It can also be used as a noun (“Let’s schedule a catch-up”), such as in the idomatic phrase “playing catch-up.” In this usage the phrase should be hyphenated, but some dictionaries note that this noun can also appear as one word.",
